# Synchronized Hats Through ESP8266 Mesh Network

This is a firmware for panama hats having a LED strip controlled by a ESP8266. We use [painlessMesh](https://github.com/gmag11/painlessMesh) to synchronize all hats together in order to have all hats playing the exact same sequence at the exact same time.

No need to connect to an exising Wi-Fi network. Just run this firmware on a couple of hats and they will play in sync.

The solution has been designed in a way that allows reusing existing sequences with very few changes.
